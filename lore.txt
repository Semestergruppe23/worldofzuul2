You wake up at the University of Southern Denmark after a party last night.
You drank way too many beers and ended up falling asleep by the main entrance.
You've noticed that all the doors are locked, and you have no way of getting out.
You're only wearing your underwear currently,
it was getting hot inside so you took off your clothes,
you can find them right next to you.
You check your phone and notice a missed call from "Mom",
you check the clock and it's 15:49 o'clock, better hurry home. 
You need to search for a key in order to get out, but be aware,
your memory will be tested,
so it's important that you pay attention to every detail,
and even note them down if you're bad at remembering things.
